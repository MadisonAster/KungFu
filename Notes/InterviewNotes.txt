I have experience with gameplay programming (primarily for VR), incorporating expiramental hardware drivers, plugin development, environment modeling, level scripting, the new python api and how it gets generated from the system module, sequencer, and I'm really fast with blueprint.


ideas:

Floating camera mode using sequencer for streams.

Post processing effect layers, customized cycling

Expanded menu system with sample editor

Physical keyboard alignment via OpenCV

Twitch donation integration, better streaming widgets
